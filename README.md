## Description

Who doesn't like an anonymous review?! The reviewers feel safe to share what they think about something and you in turn can hinge of the suspense to guessing who posted what and if the review connects any dot. You can easily share the review link with your friends and colleagues to leave a review. Maybe a review for yourself, your processes, products or company. Either ways, you get to enjoy truthful reviews. 

## Features

Here are what makes the project tick! Please go through the features to see why this project is awesome!

- Simple Dashboard
    - This is the landing page for all authenticated users. However, users would be directed to the login page when they are not authenticated. 
    - You can add customizations to change the looks of the dashboard to suit your taste. 
- User Authentication
    - Users would need to register to get their own profile and a shareable link. 
    - Anonymous users can interact with the app, but would need to be signed in if they want to read their own reviews 
- Default Message Framework Integration
    - This only improves the user's experience by letting them know the outcome of the operations that they've completed within the applicaition.
